# Fractal

## Summary

Simple Fractal program made in C

Mandatory school project made with mlx framework. I added a few additional cooler fractals because I liked them.

Program goes through the screen pixel by pixel and uses fractal formulas for calculating colors for each pixel. Mouse wheel zooms in and out of the pichture towards the cursor. Julia set changes by moving the cursor around the screen.

Fractal is a suprisingly simple program.
